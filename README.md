# LANTA Benchmark Suite

LANTA Benchmark Suite is a set of applications for measuring HPC performance on a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) system. These set of applications represent common and potential workload expected to run on Compute Node (CPU only) and GPU node of upcoming LANTA system.



taken from the pre-existing PRACE and DEISA application benchmark suites, and extended with the PRACE Accelerator Benchmark Suite. The objective is providing a single benchmark suite of scalable, currently relevant and publicly available application codes and datasets, of a size which can realistically be run on large systems, and maintained into the future.
The UEABS activity was started during the PRACE-PP project and was publicly released by the PRACE-2IP project.
The PRACE "Accelerator Benchmark Suite" was a PRACE-4IP activity.
The UEABS has been and will be actively updated and maintained by the subsequent PRACE-IP projects.
Each application code has either one, or two input datasets. If there are two datasets, Test Case A is designed to run on Tier-1 sized systems (up to around 1,000 x86 cores, or equivalent) and Test Case B is designed to run on Tier-0 sized systems (up to around 10,000 x86 cores, or equivalent). If there is only one dataset (Test Case A), it is suitable for both sizes of system.
